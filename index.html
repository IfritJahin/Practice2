        We are an undergraduate Club at BRAC University that provides students with the resources to develop robots. Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept and creation of autonomously operating machines dates back a long time, but credible research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. And today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as we continue to research, design and build new robots that serve various practical purposes including domestic, commercial and military. The Objective of ROBU is to make students familiar with these hand-on works on robotics.
